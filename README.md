# jQuery-project-2
Mobile menu  /  https://kalana1985.github.io/jQuery-project-2/.
##This is a project of TreeHouse jQuery curriculum.
#Problem

The web page is responsive but for smaller devices nav menu is mashing together creating very bad
user experience.

#Solution

To hide the text links and swap them out with a more appropriate navigation.
I manipulate the DOM using jQuery to add <select><option>..</option></select>.
added jQuery to interact with smaller devices.
